# Campsite-Website-CST205
Class project for CST 205. We are creating a website that provides brief information about a national park that the user is interested in using Python, Flask, and Bootstrap.

Project Breakdown:
This website lets you pick a national park from a list of available parks in that state. The main page starts off with a an initial flask form that has you pick a state.
After picking that state, a couple of hidden bootstrap cards show up, one that has a map that shows the location of each park and another that is a list that has links
to a details page for that national park. The details page pulls all of the info related to that national park from the NPS API and displays it in a clean, professional manner.
The top of the page has the name of the park and an image slideshow with pictures of the park pulled from the api. Below that are a few cards that shows the park description,
weather, directions, and hours they are open.

Other things we would have liked to add:
A method of saving your favorite parks would have been a good idea, as well as a map that gives you a route to all of your parks in order. We also would have liked 
to have more info on camping at the national parks (our orignal idea), but the API did not have too much info on that.
